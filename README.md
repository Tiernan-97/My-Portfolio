# My-Portfolio

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Methodology

With the use of flex boxes in CSS, I have deployed a webpage which I can use a basis for my constantly growing portfolio filled with my projects. The webpage includes my name, a recent photo and links to sections about me. When a link is clicked on in the navigation bar, it automatically scrolls to that part of the webpage. I gave all of the images titles, and made sure that the first project is larger than the others. I implemented attributes to the images so that when they're clicked on, you're taken to the corresponding projects deployed site. As a result of using flex display, when the page is resized, the layout is reposive and adapts to the users viewpoint.
